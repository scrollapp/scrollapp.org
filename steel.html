<p>
<b>Civilization is deteriorating, and there's no way to stop it.</b>
</p>

<p>
Birth rates have plummetted. Suicide rates have exploded. Familes are broken. Social media is tearing apart the fabric of human relationships. Rampant inflation has killed economic mobility. Most institutions are corrupt beyond repair. People in positions of power are in the business of lying about everything.
</p>

<p>
It's easy for some to get "black pilled", which to give up hope for the future and live in a state of perpetual misery. But it's easy for others to be "white pilled", which is to live in a state of ignorance, believing that these problems aren't real, or aren't that bad.
</p>

<p>
But there is another group of people that know just how dire the circumstances of our world are, but use it to drive motivation rather than nihilism. They recognize that aspects of civilization are inevitably going to come crashing down. But they see this not as a reason for dispair, but rather as the greatest opportunity since the dawn of civilization to rebuild greatness from the ashes.
</p>

<p>
These folks are some of the strongest, most hardened warriors of society. They've put their entire lives on the line to create pathways to salvation for others. They've answered the call of duty to create, to innovate, to inspire, and to lead.
</p>

<p>
We call these people the unshakable heroes that have "taken the Steel Pill".
</p>

<p>
Join Paul Gordon where he explores the facinating work being done by these heroes to recreate the ingredients of healthy civilization and deliver us from destruction. 
</p>

<p>
This podcast isn't a game of softball. We ask hard questions. We get into spirited debates at times. The world is going to hell in a handbasket. We're not going to achieve deliverance by fluffing people up.
</p>

<p>
The heroes we feature are have all been inspired to fight the battles that have been presented before them. And we hope their stories can inspire you to start fighting yours.
